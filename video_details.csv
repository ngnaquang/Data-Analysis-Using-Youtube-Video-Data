One of the most enduringly exquisite elements is embroidery, and the decoration of designs such as the original 'Miss Dior' dress of 1949 and a gown ordered by an American couture client provided the spark that resulted in the embellishment of men’s pieces in this exceptional cross-over exercise in savoir-faire. Along with transposing the image of Monsieur Dior’s dog, Bobby, rhinestones were employed enthusiastically, whether daubed on leather derbies or glittering on brilliantly bejeweled jackets.

A visit to the atelier reveals how the canvas layer that traditionally and invisibly structures the front of men’s jackets has been utilized to shape the style’s distinctive suppressed waist and flaring peplums through the architectural employing of darts and pleats. By using predominantly dry fabrics in weaves such as houndstooth and Prince of Wales check - both possessing a significant Dior pedigree - the authentic appropriation for menswear is assured.

By moving from pure audio, this highly-illustrated video format allows for a full immersion into the House’s history and heritage, offering fascinating insights for the viewer into the founding couturier’s own life, the friends who surrounded him, outside influences, and the work of his successors right up to the present day.

This second A.B.C.Dior episode explores the letter ‘E’ for ‘Étoile’, the French word for star. This celestial symbol can boast an importance unlike few other codes, for it was the chance finding of a small metal star on the street that convinced the hesitant and superstitious Monsieur Dior to found his own couture house. And the rest, as they say, is history!

Stay tuned for more engaging and informative videos exploring the Dior codes.

The bag's apparent fragility is contradicted by the material's glass-like resistance; graphic lines are transformed into ethereal curves. It is a creation like a mirage, a poetic illusion where infinite possibilities blossom.

950,Wnbv5d6ohHo,Christian Dior,Maison Christian Dior - Mathias Kiss,"Mathias Kiss

Having spent 15 years training with the Compagnons (touring apprentices), Mathias Kiss is a contemporary artist who reflects on the deconstruction of a classical heritage at the crossroads of painting, sculpture, and architecture. In 2002 he and Olivier Piel set up a studio-workshop named Attialou, which became a space for research, installations, performances, and stage design. In 2008 he created a sensation with his piece ""Sans 90 degré."" His work is currently on display in HERITAGES at the regional contemporary art centre, l'ar[T]senal Dreux, from May 4 – September 16 2018, and was recently in Paris, with NEW LIGHTS from April 5 – June 30 2018 at the Galerie Léage.



Childhood smells of petrol stations, turpentine and waxed wooden floors come back to him. Today, the daily life of this ""2000%"" urbanite is dominated by the chemicals he uses in his creations. Sporty smells of camphor also figure for this artist who spent long years travelling and studying with the Compagnons, but who also shone at Thai boxing. For the Franco-Hungarian, the smell of the rain on the tarmac is a powerful evocation of Paris.

Mathias Kiss chose ""Cologne Royale"" perfume","['Dior', 'Christian Dior', '2017']",2018-09-21 14:24:27+00:00,12860.0,116.0,,,0.0,PT1M,hd,true,Friday,60.0,3,"['Maison', 'Christian', 'Dior', '-', 'Mathias', 'Kiss']"
951,C-auM04d1ic,Christian Dior,Maison Christian Dior - Sonia Sieff,"A fashion photographer and spokesmodel sought out by major luxury and cosmetics houses, Sonia Sieff is the perfect embodiment of the oft-evoked Parisian style. The daughter of photographer JeanLoup Sieff, this eclectic traveler published her first book, ""Les Françaises"" in 2017 with Rizzoli. In it, 155 photographs of female nudes present a manifesto for beauty and freedom.
She starts by evoking scents linked to the men she loves: the leather of her father's car, her son's clothes, a tee-shirt, etc. Perfume is second nature for this sensual woman of images with the style of a film star. She detects an unusual smell in the flash of her camera and likes the warm scent of nights where anything goes.
Sonia Sieff chose ""Ambre Nuit"" perfume","['Dior', 'Christian Dior', '2017']",2018-09-21 14:21:12+00:00,9265.0,84.0,,,0.0,PT1M1S,hd,true,Friday,61.0,3,"['Maison', 'Christian', 'Dior', '-', 'Sonia', 'Sieff']"

She was then voted the first runner-up in Miss France 2007 contest. Deaf from birth, she speaks sign language and has also learned to speak and lip-read. She published Miss et source! (A beauty queen and deaf!) (2008), appeared in the film The Perfect Date (2010), took part in Dancing With the Stars on TF1 (2015), and in La robe de ma vie  (the Dress of my Life) on M6 (2017).

The smells of the sun, the sea, and the sand give her confidence. Gracious and luminous Sophie Vouzelaud draws on her memories to give us an incredibly poetic description of her olfactive sensations. Her arms whirl through the air as her hands emphatically sign the importance of childhood smells. ""If there is no smell, there is no love!"" she says.

She herself is a genuine lesson in style, and her look is a manifesto for the famous ""Parisian chic."" 

The personification of French elegance, Mathilde Favier reveals the refined interior of her Paris apartment and her subtle olfactive memories. Tuberose, violet, and powdery scents are precisely recalled. A warm and gracious portrait reveals a fashion woman who proclaims her loyalty to her scent.

His bouquets are poetry, yet he himself prefers citrus scents. Pierre Banchereau is the florist at Debeaulieu, named for his beloved grandmother. He vividly recalls the smell of her hairspray and the golden colour of her hair. Each of his precise movements is imbued with elegance, and this stylish Parisian aspires to make a French skill live on, in a modern way.

She was then the spirited Miss Météo on the Canal plus Grand Journal programme, before going on to appear on the big screen in Asterix and Obelix: God Save Britannia by Laurent Tirard in 2012. This was followed by roles in France and abroad in ""Mood Indigo"" by Michel Gondry, ""Yves Saint Laurent"" by Jalil Lespert, and more recently, ""The Promise"" by Terry George.

Does space have a smell? The poetic and passionate young actress revisits smells that have touched her with compelling frankness. She is gracious and bubbly, telling us that she loves white summer flowers, the memory of the Monoï oil that her mother used, and the scent of wooden pencils from her childhood. She also humorously detects a scent she adores in her own sneezes…

981,SRHbOxBh6BU,Christian Dior,Maison Christian Dior - Jean Imbert,"Young star chef Jean Imbert won season 3 of M6's reality TV cookery show, Top Chef, in 2012. Trained at the Institut Bocuse in Lyon, he opened his first restaurant, ""L’Acajou"" in Paris in 2004, which was frequented by numerous celebrities. Since 2017 he has presented the TV show ""Qui sera le prochain grand chef pâtissier?"" (Who will be the next great patisserie chef?) on France 2. Following his ""Les Bols de Jean"" chain of restaurants in Paris, he is preparing to open a new restaurant in New York named ""Encore."" 

Jean Imbert emphasizes that smells take time. The star chef would like more than anything to capture the smells of his native Brittany – sea air, grilled fish and coastal pines – in a bottle. He happily reveals his Parisian paradise, which takes the shape of an urban vegetable garden that he loves more than anything else, right in the middle of the 16th arrondissement. His memories are linked to the kitchen noises that have been with him since childhood, and to the warm, convivial atmospheres that he likes to precision-craft with his brilliant cuisine of course, and also with scented candles.

Jean Imbert chose the ""Bois d’Argent"" candle

In order to create this long dress’ white lace, Maria Grazia Chiuri was inspired by vintage models and more particularly a collar drawn from the archives of the lacemaker Potencier Broderies. The original motif, enriched with cotton flowers, has been redrawn stitch by stitch before being saved into a computer program. Then, in the final step of this modern technique, it is meticulously cut out to produce the transparent guipure effect and give body to the dress’ flounces.
